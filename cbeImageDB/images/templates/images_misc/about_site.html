<h2 align="center"> <b> **Testing for the CBE Seminar** </b> </h2>
If you'd like to test the database prior to the CBE seminar on Thrusday, October
15th, please feel free to upload any random image. The values on the upload page
for the image do not matter for now. All of the images will be removed after th 
seminar before the database is fully ready for use. The database will be ready
for biofilm images on Thrusday, October 22nd at 9:00am.                     
</br>
Thank you for your time in testing out our CBE Image Database!

<h1 align="center"> CBE Image Database </h1>
<h2 align="center"> About </h2>
<p> The image database is designed to store biofilm images, to help with
organization, and to help prevent loss of data. The database allows users to
upload and search biofilm images based on a set of attributes such as
associated labs, organisms, and microscope settings. </p>
<p> Images are classified under experiments and projects. Experiments are meant
for a round of imaging using the same sample, while projects are more for the
larger picture. There can be many images to an experiment and many experiments
to a project. </p>

<h2 align="center"> Data Model </h2>
<img src="{% static "images/data-model.png" %}" alt="Data model image"
width=50% height="auto" align="left" style=”margin: 0px 5px 5px 5px;/>
<p> A data model shows how the different objects {# TODO: Correct word #} are
related to each other.
In the diagram to the left, there are three objects represented: project,
experiment, and image.
The arrows show relationships between them.
</p>
<h4> Project </h4>
{#<p> {{ help_text_project }}</p>#}
<p>The project encompasses a related set of images and experiments, such as all
the images associated with a paper.
The project only has one attribute, the name.
Users are able to create new projects, by clicking "Create &#60project_name>"
while uploading an image.</p>

<h4> Experiment </h4>
<p> {{ help_text_experiment }} </p>

<h2 align="center"> Features </h2>
<h4> Uploading Images </h4>
<p>When a user first uploads an image, a new experiment is created under a
specific project. An experiment is designed to hold only images relating to
a single experiment. If a user is taking images from multiple different
samples, they should use the upload image tab when moving onto a new sample. A
user can upload multiple images to a given experiment. </p>

<h4> Searching </h4>
<p> Users can either search by <a href={% url 'images:attribute_search'%} 
>individual attributes</a>
or by <a href={% url 'images:general_search'%}>general search</a> as well as by 
the terms that appear in the image descriptions. {# This feel unclear #}
In the attribute search, the values for each attribute are broken down into
their own search field.
In the general search, all the attributes are combined into one search field.
If nothing is entered in the search, all images in the database
will be shown. Clicking on the image on the search results page
will bring the user to a page a details page showing all the images
information.</p>
<p> Please note, images that appear in search results will have a release date
of the current date or lower. Images with a release date in the future can
only be viewed by admin. </p>

{% if user.is_superuser %}
<h4> Admin </h4>
<p> Admin are able to create new growth mediums, growth substratums, labs,
microscope settings, objective mediums, organisms, projects, and vessels. To
upload a new image, admin must use the upload image page on the main website. 
A link to modify image information can be found on the details page for that
image. </p>
<p>Admin are able to search all images regardless of their release date.
Regular users only have access to images that have a release date equal or
less than the current day. Admin are also able to view the associated
experiments with images from the image details page. </p>
